  Seminar talks at NIU in March 2019

I give two talks at the [Northern Illinois University mathematics
colloquium](http://www.math.niu.edu/colloq/).

Here are the abstracts, and links for the slides (as pdf documents):

+ [Group cohomology and Levi decompositions for linear groups] (Mar 21)
                
  *Abstract*: If $G$ is a linear algebraic group over a field $F$, we
  describe what the Hochschild cohomology of $G$ with coefficients in
  linear representations of $G$ says about those algebraic groups
  which are extensions of $G$ by connected unipotent algebraic groups
  over $F$. If $G$ is reductive and if $F$ has characteristic zero --
  say, if $F$ is the field of complex numbers -- one knows that every
  such extension is trivial. But if $F$ has positive characteristic,
  there are non-trivial extensions -- i.e. there are linear groups
  with no Levi decomposition. The talk will give details and examples
  about these notions and results.

+ [Some tools for the study of reductive groups over local fields] (Mar 22)

  *Abstract*: Let $K$ be a local field -- i.e. the field of fractions
  of a complete discrete valuation ring $A$. The study of linear
  algebraic groups $G$ over such fields $K$ has applications in number
  theory and algebraic geometry.  Some reductive groups (“split
  groups”) have models over $A$ which are reductive. But e.g. if $G$
  does not become split upon base change with any unramified extension
  of $K$, it can happen that $G$ has no reductive model.  Our interest
  here is in an interesting family of models for $G$ -- the so-called
  parahoric group schemes $P$. If $k$ denotes the residue field of
  $A$, then by “base-change”, $P$ determines a linear algebraic group
  $P_k$ over $k$.  When $P$ is not reductive, we investigate the
  question: does $P_k$ have a Levi decomposition (as in the first
  talk)?  This second talk will include a good bit of example-oriented
  background discussion.
