I was an invited participant in the `BIRS workshop on Groups and
Geometries`_ Aug 26--Aug 30, 2019.

Unfortunately, while talking about some mathematics with a colleague,
we got distracted and showed up a few minutes too late for the `Group
Photo`_ ... Whoops!
  
As is fairly traditional in week-long workshops, Wednesday afternoon
was "open" for activities. A group of us had a nice hike at the
`C-Level Cirque`_:
