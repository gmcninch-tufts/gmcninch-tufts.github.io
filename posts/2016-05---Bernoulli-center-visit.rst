I was an academic visitor for about 3 weeks in July 2016 at the
`Centre Intrafacultaire Bernoulli`_, l'École Polytechnique Fédérale de
Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland) during the program on *Local
Representation Theory and Simple Groups* organized by Donna Testerman
(EPFL), Gunter Malle (TU Kaiserslautern), and Radha Kessar (City
University London).

I enjoyed following lectures by Markus Linckelmann (City University
London), Meinolf Geck (Universität Stuttgart), Marc Cabanes
(Université Paris Diderot), Britta Späth (Bergische Universität
Wuppertal), and Olivier Dudas (Université Paris Diderot) on - among
other things - block theory, and aspects of the Deligne-Lusztig
description of representations of finite reductive groups.
