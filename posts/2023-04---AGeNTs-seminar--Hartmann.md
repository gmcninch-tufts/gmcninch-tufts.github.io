**Speaker:** [Julia Hartmann (UPenn)](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~hartmann/)

**Title:** Local-global principles for linear algebraic groups over arithmetic
function fields

**Abstract:**
Arithmetic function fields are one variable function fields over
complete discretely valued fields. These fields naturally admit several
collections of overfields with respect to which one can study
local-global principles. The talk will concern local-global principles
for torsors under linear algebraic groups, coming from patching. (Joint
work with J.L.-Colliot-Thélène, D. Harbater, D. Krashen, R. Parimala,
and V. Suresh. )
