  Workshop on Representation Theory and Reductive groups at the
  Mittag-Leffler institute.
---

In May 2016, I attended a week-long workshop on [Branching Problems
for Reductive Groups] at the [Institut Mittag-Leffler] (Djursholm,
Sweden).

I gave a lecture on *An overview of representations of reductive
algebraic groups*; essentially everything I discussed can be found in
the text of Jens Jantzen on the representation theory of algebraic
groups. I tried to focus on things that seem to me to be relevant to
the difficulties presented by modular representation theory to
“branching problems”:

 - (Hochschild) cohomology,
 - the description of simple representations for reductive groups,
 - reduction $\mod p$ and
 - the Jantzen filtration of Weyl modules $\Delta(\lambda)$.


Here are the [slides from my talk].
