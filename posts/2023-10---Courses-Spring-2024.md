  Description of courses I'm teaching Spring 2024 in the math dept at Tufts University.
---
  
I'm teaching two courses in Spring 2024, and I thought I'd post the course descriptions here.
  
- Modeling

  The first is [Math 087 *Mathematical Modeling*](/assets/images/2024-spring--Math087-MathematicalModelling.pdf).
  
  I taught this course Fall 2020 and really enjoyed it. Looking forward to teaching it again!
  
  As some practical information, for code use I'll mostly use *python*
  together with various scientific computing libraries (numpy, scipy,
  pandas, ...), and I plan to use *jupyter notebooks* both in the
  lectures and for course notes. There are some more details in the
  course description (the link above).
  
- Topics: *Applied Algebra*

  The other course i [Math 190 *Topics in Algebra*](/assets/images/2024-spring--Math190--topics-in-algebra.pdf).

  As a quick summary, I plan to cover three different components (each about 4 weeks):
  
  - linear representations of finite groups
  - error correcting codes
  - formalization of mathematics
  
  See the course description (the link above) for a little more
  info. If you have questions, write and ask!
