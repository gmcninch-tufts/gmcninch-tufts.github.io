The Spring Eastern Sectional Meeting of the AMS was held at

At this meeting, there was a special session on `Combinatorial Aspects
of Nilpotent Orbits`_ organized by Anthony Iarrobino (Northeastern
University), Leila Khatami (Union College) and Juliana Tymoczko (Smith
College).

In this session, I gave a presentation on *Centralizers of nilpotent
elements*; here are the `slides for my talk`_.
