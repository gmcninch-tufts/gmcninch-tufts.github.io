The [Workshop on Lie Theory, Representation Theory and Algebraic
Groups] was held at the University of Manchester (UK) Sept 11-14, 2017
as part of the series "Algebra and Representation Theory in the North"
(ARTIN).


I contributed a lecture on the *Nilpotent orbits of a reductive group
over a local field*.
