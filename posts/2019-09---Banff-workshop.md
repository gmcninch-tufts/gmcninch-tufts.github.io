I was an invited participant in the [BIRS workshop on Groups and
Geometries] Aug 26--Aug 30, 2019.

It is always nice to see Banff! I was first at a meeting at BIRS in (I
think?) 1993 or 1994, while I was still a graduate student. I was back
in 2007 ("Algebraic Lie Theory") and in 2015 ("Linear Algebraic Groups
in Number Theory and Geometry").

During the present meeting I was "talking mathematics" with a
colleague, and we unfortunately managed to show up a few minutes too
late for the [Group Photo] ... Whoops!
  
As is fairly traditional in week-long workshops, Wednesday afternoon
was "open" for activities. A group of us had a nice hike at the
[C-Level Cirque]:
