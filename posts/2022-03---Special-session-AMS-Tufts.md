[Eric Sommers](https://people.math.umass.edu/~esommers/) and I organized a [special session on Linear
Algebraic Groups: their Structure, Representations, and
Geometry](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2291_program_ss12.html#title)
in the (virtual) [AMS sectional
meeting](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2291_program.html)
originally intended to be held at [Tufts

Thanks to all the speakers for nice talks!
