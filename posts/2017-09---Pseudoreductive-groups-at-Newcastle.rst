  I spoke in a workshop on pseudo-reductive groups at Newcastle.

My colleague `David Stewart`_ organized a `workshop on
Pseudo-reductive groups`_ in September 2017, which was partially
funded by the Heilbronn Institute.

In this workshop, Gopal Prasad gave a mini-course on his work with
Conrad and Gabber on pseudo-reductive groups.

I contributed a lecture on *Reductive subgroups of parahoric group
schemes*.  Here is the abstract for my talk:

   Let :math:`K` be the field of fractions of a complete discrete
   valuation ring :math:`A` with residue field :math:`k`, and let
   :math:`G` be a connected reductive algebraic group over :math:`K`.
   Suppose :math:`P` is a parahoric group scheme attached to
   :math:`G`. In particular, :math:`P` is a smooth affine
   :math:`A`-group scheme having generic fiber :math:`P_K = G`; the
   group scheme :math:`P` is in general not reductive over
   :math:`A`. Assume that :math:`G` splits over an unramified
   extension of :math:`K`.

   The talk will give an overview of two results about :math:`G`.

   First, there is a closed and reductive :math:`A`-subgroup scheme
   :math:`M` of :math:`P` for which the special fiber :math:`M_k` is a
   Levi factor of :math:`P_k`. Moreover, the reductive subgroups of
   :math:`G=P_K` of the form :math:`M_K` may be characterized.

   Second, let :math:`X` be a nilpotent section in
   :math:`\operatorname{Lie}(P)`. We say that :math:`X` is balanced if
   the fibers :math:`C_K` and :math:`C_k` are smooth group schemes of
   the same dimension, where :math:`C=C_P(X)` is the scheme theoretic
   centralizer of :math:`X`. If :math:`X_0` is a given nilpotent
   element in the Lie algebra of the reductive quotient of the special
   fiber :math:`P_k`, we give results on the possible *lifts* of
   :math:`X_0` to a balanced nilpotent section :math:`X \in
   \operatorname{Lie}(P)`.
