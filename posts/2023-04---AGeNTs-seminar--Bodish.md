**Title**: *Fundamental tilting modules for the quantum symplectic group*

**Abstract**:
For a simple Lie group the irreducible representations with
fundamental highest weight generate the category of all finite
dimensional representations. In the case of classical groups, one hopes
to find constructions of the fundamental modules using linear
algebra. For SL(V), the fundamental representations are exactly the
non-trivial exterior powers of V. For the symplectic group Sp(V), the
fundamental representations are kernels of the operators ``contraction
with the symplectic form”” acting on the exterior powers of V.

The contraction operator and the ``multiplication by the symplectic
form” operator generate an action of SL(2) on the exterior algebra of
V. The SL(2) action commutes with Sp(V), and each action generates the
others centralizer. Such phenomenon is referred to as Howe duality.

A major open problem in modular representation theory is to compute the
characters of tilting modules. The slightly more well-known problem of
determining characters of irreducible modules for symmetric groups in
finite characteristic is a subproblem. Adamovich and Rybnikov studied
some positive characteristic versions of Howe duality. McNinch then
leveraged these dualities to, among other things, decompose the exterior
powers into indecomposable tilting modules and then describe the
characters of fundamental tilting modules for Sp(V).

In my talk I will discuss recent work with Daniel Tubbenhauer
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04264) which generalizes the Sp (V)-SL(2)
duality to the case of quantum groups. I will also mention a non-trivial
canonical basis for the exterior algebra which realizes the Weyl module
filtration, and how to compute the characters of fundamental tilting
modules for quantum groups.
