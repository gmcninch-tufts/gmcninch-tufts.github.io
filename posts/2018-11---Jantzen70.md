  their Representations.”

I gave one of the lectures at the workshop on [Algebraic Groups, Lie
Algebras and their Representations] held at the [Max Planck Institute]
(Bonn, Germany) to celebrate the 70th birthday of [Jens Carsten
Jantzen].

I've known Jens Carsten since I was a graduate student -- he was on
the faculty at the University of Oregon before he moved to Århus in
(roughly?) 1995, and I was a Ph.D. student at Oregon (I finished in
1996). It was very participate in this workshop celebrating his
birthday!
