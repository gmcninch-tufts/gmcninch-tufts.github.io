  Workshop on Representation Theory and Reductive groups at the
  Mittag-Leffler institute.
---

In May 2016, I attended a week-long workshop on `Branching Problems
for Reductive Groups`_ at the `Institut Mittag-Leffler`_
(Djursholm, Sweden).

I gave a lecture on *An overview of representations of reductive
algebraic groups*; essentially everything I discussed can be found in
the text of Jens Jantzen on the representation theory of algebraic
groups. I tried to focus on things that seem to me to be relevant to
the difficulties presented by modular representation theory to
“branching problems”:

 - (Hochschild) cohomology,
 - the description of simple representations for reductive groups,
 - reduction mod :math:`p` and
 - the Jantzen filtration of Weyl modules :math:`\Delta(\lambda)`.


Here are the `slides from my talk`_.
