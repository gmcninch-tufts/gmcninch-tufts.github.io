While I'll still use [`Canvas`](https://canvas.tufts.edu) to some
extent, I plan to post most of the /content/ of my courses this spring
at the following URLS:

- [Math 065 Math Bridge to Higher Math](https://gmcninch.math.tufts.edu/2025-Fa-Math065)

- [Math 245 Graduate Algebra I](https://gmcninch.math.tufts.edu/2025-Sp-Math245)
