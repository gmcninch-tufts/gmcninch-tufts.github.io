Abstract:

Let $k$ be a field, and let $G$ be a linear algebraic group over $k$
for which the unipotent radical $U$ of $G$ is defined and split over
$k$.  Consider a finite, separable field extension $\ell$ of $k$ and
suppose that the group $G_\ell$ obtained by base-change has a *Levi
decomposition* (over $\ell$). We continue here our study of the
question previously investigated in (McNinch 2013): does $G$ have a
*Levi decomposition* (over $k$)?

Using non-abelian cohomology we give some condition under which this
question has an affirmative answer.  On the other hand, we provide
an(other) example of a group $G$ as above which has no Levi
decomposition over $k$.
