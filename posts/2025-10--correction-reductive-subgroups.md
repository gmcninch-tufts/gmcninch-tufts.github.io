  Corrects a flaw in the published proof to one of the results of the paper.
---

In the published version of the [manuscript "Reductive subgroup
schemes of a parahoric group
scheme"](/pages/manuscripts.html#reductive-subgroup-schemes-of-a-parahoric-group-scheme),
the proof of Theorem
4.5.6 is flawed and should be corrected 
[as described here](/assets/manuscripts/errata/2025-10-12--reductive-subgroups-fix.pdf).  

I would like to thank Anis Zidani for bringing the flawed proof to my
attention, and for critical comments on some preliminary attempts to
fix the error.
