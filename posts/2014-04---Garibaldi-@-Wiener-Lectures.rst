`Skip Garibaldi`_ gave the `Wiener Lectures`_ in the Tufts University
Math Department in April 2014.

      + *Some people have all the luck* (public lecture) 

        **Abstract:** Winning a prize of at least $600 in the lottery
        is a remarkable thing - for a scratcher ticket the odds are
        worse than 1-in-1200 and 1-in-9000 is a more typical figure.
        Some people have won many of these large prizes, and clearly
        they are very lucky or they buy a ton of lottery tickets.
        When we investigated records of all claimed lottery prizes, we
        discovered that some people had won hundreds of these prizes!
        Such people seem to be not just lucky, but suspiciously lucky.
        I will explain what we thought they might have been up to,
        what mathematics says about it, and what further
        investigations revealed.  This talk is about joint work with
        Lawrence Mower, an investigative reporter for the Palm Beach
        Post, and Philip B. Stark, professor and chair of the UC
        Berkeley Department of Statistics.

      + *Topological and generic methods in algebra* (math major lecture) 

        **Abstract:** In calculus we take limits and think about
        graphs all the time, and it would be nice to be able to use
        the same sorts of techniques in courses like abstract linear
        algebra and abstract algebra, even when you aren’t working
        with real or complex numbers. I’ll explain how these
        techniques can be used and give some examples of their
        application.

      + *Simple algebraic groups and polynomial invariants*
        (colloquium lecture)

        **Abstract:** The classical “linear preserver problem” asks:
        Given a polynomial in finitely many variables, what is the
        group of linear transformations that preserve it?  This
        problem has been solved for many interesting polynomials,
        usually by means that are special to the particular polynomial
        under consideration.  We turn this problem on its head by
        starting with a polynomial that is preserved by a simple
        algebraic group and observe that the full preserver can be
        described by a general theorem.  The results are new even in
        the case where the field is the complex numbers, and as an
        application we shed some light on a 125+ year old problem.
        This is joint work with Bob Guralnick.
