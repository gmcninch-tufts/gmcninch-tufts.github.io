  I gave a talk in a special session in the Fresno AMS sectional meeting
---

I attended the [American Math Society Sectional Meeting at California
State University,
Fresno](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2293_program.html).  I
spoke in the [Special Session on Methods in Non-Semisimple
Representation
Categories](https://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2293_program_ss11.html#title)
organized by my colleagues Eric Friedlander, Julia Pevtsova, and Paul
Sobaje.

You can find [my abstract
here](https://meetings.ams.org/math/spring2023w/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/25180). The
talk actually had a slightly different emphasis than the abstract
suggested.

[Here are the slides of my
talk.](../assets/slides/2023-05-McNinch-nilpotent-and-parahoric.pdf)

In fact, here are the [slides of many of the talks of the
session](https://sites.math.washington.edu//~julia/AMS_FRESNO_2023/).
