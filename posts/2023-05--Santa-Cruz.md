Title: Reductive subgroup schemes of a parahoric group scheme

Abstract:

Let G be a reductive algebraic group over K where K is the field of
fractions of a complete discrete valuation ring A. The parahoric group
schemes attached to G are certain smooth group schemes P over A for
which the group P_K obtained by base-change coincides with G.

Write k for the residue field of A. In general, the special fiber P_k of
a parahoric group scheme is not reductive.  When G splits over an
unramified extension of K, we proved in a relatively recent paper that
for any parahoric group scheme P attached to G that there is a closed
A-subgroup scheme M of P for which the special fiber M_k is a Levi
factor of the group P_k, and the generic fiber M_K is a maximal rank
reductive subgroup of P_K = G.

The talk will aim to describe this result and some background material:
among other things, it will describe the notion of a Levi factor, of a
parahoric group scheme, and of a maximal rank reductive subgroup.
