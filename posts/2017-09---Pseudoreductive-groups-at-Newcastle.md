  I spoke in a workshop on pseudo-reductive groups at Newcastle.

My colleague [David Stewart] organized a [workshop on Pseudo-reductive
groups] in September 2017, which was partially funded by the Heilbronn
Institute.

In this workshop, Gopal Prasad gave a mini-course on his work with
Conrad and Gabber on pseudo-reductive groups.

I contributed a lecture on *Reductive subgroups of parahoric group
schemes*.  Here is the abstract for my talk:

   > Let $K$ be the field of fractions of a complete discrete
   > valuation ring $A$ with residue field $k$, and let $G$ be a
   > connected reductive algebraic group over $K$. Suppose $P$ is a
   > parahoric group scheme attached to $G$. In particular, $P$ is a
   > smooth affine $A$-group scheme having generic fiber $P_K = G$;
   > the group scheme $P$ is in general not reductive over $A$. Assume
   > that $G$ splits over an unramified extension of $K$.

   > The talk will give an overview of two results about $G$.

   > First, there is a closed and reductive $A$-subgroup scheme $M$ of
   > $P$ for which the special fiber $M_k$ is a Levi factor of
   > $P_k$. Moreover, the reductive subgroups of $G=P_K$ of the form
   > $M_K$ may be characterized.

   > Second, let $X$ be a nilpotent section in
   > $\operatorname{Lie}(P)$. We say that $X$ is balanced if the
   > fibers $C_K$ and $C_k$ are smooth group schemes of the same
   > dimension, where $C=C_P(X)$ is the scheme theoretic centralizer
   > of $X$. If $X_0$ is a given nilpotent element in the Lie algebra
   > of the reductive quotient of the special fiber $P_k$, we give
   > results on the possible *lifts* of $X_0$ to a balanced nilpotent
   > section $X \in \operatorname{Lie}(P)$.
