> **Abstract**:

> Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a *local field* -- i.e. the field of fractions
> of a complete DVR $\mathscr{A}$ whose residue field $\mathcal{k}$ has
> characteristic $p > 0$ -- and let $G$ be a connected, absolutely
> simple algebraic $\mathcal{K}$-group $G$ which splits over an unramified
> extension of $\mathcal{K}$. We study the rational nilpotent orbits of
> $G$-- i.e. the orbits of $G(\mathcal{K})$ in the nilpotent elements of
> $\operatorname{Lie}(G)(\mathcal{K})$ -- under the assumption $p>2h-2$ where $h$ is
> the Coxeter number of $G$.

>  A reductive group $M$ over $\mathcal{K}$ is *unramified* if there
>  is a reductive model $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathscr{A}$ for which $M =
>  \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{K}$. Our main result shows for any nilpotent element $X_1
>  \in \operatorname{Lie}(G)$ that there is an unramified, reductive
>  $\mathcal{K}$-subgroup $M$ which contains a maximal torus of $G$ and
>  for which $X_1 \in \operatorname{Lie}(M)$ is *geometrically
>  distinguished*.

>  The proof uses a variation on a result of DeBacker relating the
>  nilpotent orbits of $G$ with the nilpotent orbits of the
>  reductive quotient of the special fiber for the various parahoric
>  group schemes associated with $G$.
