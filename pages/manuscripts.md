## Nilpotent elements and reductive subgroups over a local field {#nilpotent-elements-and-reductive-subgroups-over-a-local-field}

   **Abstract:**
   Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a *local field* -- i.e. the field of fractions of
   a complete DVR $\mathscr{A}$ whose residue field $\mathcal{k}$ has
   characteristic $p > 0$ -- and let $G$ be a connected, absolutely
   simple algebraic $\mathcal{K}$-group $G$ which splits over an
   unramified extension of $\mathcal{K}$. We study the rational nilpotent
   orbits of $G$-- i.e. the orbits of $G(\mathcal{K})$ in the nilpotent
   elements of $\operatorname{Lie}(G)(\mathcal{K})$ -- under the
   assumption $p>2h-2$ where $h$ is the Coxeter number of $G$.
   
   A reductive group $M$ over $\mathcal{K}$ is *unramified* if there is a
   reductive model $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathscr{A}$ for which $M =
   \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{K}$. Our main result shows for any nilpotent
   element $X_1 \in \operatorname{Lie}(G)$ that there is an unramified,
   reductive $\mathcal{K}$-subgroup $M$ which contains a maximal torus of
   $G$ and for which $X_1 \in \operatorname{Lie}(M)$ is *geometrically
   distinguished*.
   
   The proof uses a variation on a result of DeBacker relating the
   nilpotent orbits of $G$ with the nilpotent orbits of the reductive
   quotient of the special fiber for the various parahoric group schemes
   associated with $G$.

## Reductive subgroup schemes of a parahoric group scheme {#reductive-subgroup-schemes-of-a-parahoric-group-scheme}

   **Abstract:**
   Let $K$ be the field of fractions of a complete discrete valuation
   ring $A$ with residue field $k$, and let $G$ be a connected reductive
   algebraic group over $K$. Suppose $P$ is a parahoric group scheme
   attached to $G$. In particular, $P$ is a smooth affine $A$-group
   scheme having generic fiber $P_K = G$; the group scheme $P$ is in
   general not reductive over $A$.
     
   If $G$ splits over an unramified extension of $K$, we find in this
   paper a closed and reductive A-subgroup scheme $M ⊂ P$ for which the
   special fiber $M_k$ is a Levi factor of $P_k$. Moreover, we show that
   the generic fiber $M_K$ is a subgroup of G which is geometrically of
   type $C(μ)$ -- i.e. after a separable field extension, $M_K$ is the
   identity component $M_K = C_G^o(φ)$ of the centralizer of the image of
   a homomorphism $φ:μ_n → H$, where $μ_n$ is the group scheme of $n$-th
   roots of unity for some $n \gt 2$.  For a connected and split
   reductive group $H$ over any field $F$, the paper describes those
   subgroups of $H$ which are of type $C(μ)$.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a connected, semisimple algebraic group over a field $k$
   whose characteristic is *very good* for $G$. In a canonical manner,
   one associates to a nilpotent element $X \in \operatorname{Lie}(G)$ a
   parabolic subgroup $P$ -- in characteristic zero, $P$ may be described
   using an $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ triple containing $X$; in general, $P$ is
   the “instability parabolic” for $X$ as in geometric invariant theory.
   In this setting, we are concerned with the center $Z(C)$ of the
   centralizer $C$ of $X$ in $G$.  Choose a Levi factor $L$ of $P$, and
   write $d$ for the dimension of the center $Z(L)$. Finally, assume that
   the nilpotent element $X$ is *even*. In this case, we can *deform*
   $\operatorname{Lie}(L)$ to $\operatorname{Lie}(C)$, and our
   deformation produces a $d$ dimensional subalgebra of
   $\operatorname{Lie}(Z(C))$. Since $Z(C)$ is a smooth group scheme, it
   follows that $\dim Z(C) \ge d = \dim Z(L)$.  In fact, Lawther and
   Testerman have proved that $\dim Z(C) = \dim Z(L)$.  Despite only
   yielding a partial result, the interest in the method found in the
   present work is that it avoids the extensive case checking carried out
   by Lawther-Testerman in the memoir [LT 11].

## Linearity for actions on vector groups {#linearity-for-actions-on-vector-groups}
   **Citation:** Journal of Algebra 397 (2014), pp. 666--688.
   
   
   
   
   URLs: [[PDF]](/assets/manuscripts/linearity-for-actions-on-vector-groups---2013-09.pdf), [[MR]](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=MR3119244) and [[DOI]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2013.08.030).
   
   **Abstract:**
   Let $k$ be an arbitrary field, let $G$ be a (smooth) linear algebraic
   group over $k$, and let $U$ be a vector group over $k$ on which $G$
   acts by automorphisms of algebraic groups. The action of $G$ on $U$ is
   said to be *linear* if there is a G equivariant isomorphism of
   algebraic groups $U \simeq \operatorname{Lie}(U)$.
     
   Suppose that $G$ is connected and that the unipotent radical of $G$ is
   defined over $k$.  If the $G$ module $\operatorname{Lie}(U)$ is
   simple, we show that the action of $G$ on $U$ is linear.  If $G$ acts
   by automorphisms on a connected, split unipotent group $U$, we deduce
   that $U$ has a filtration by $G$ invariant closed subgroups for which
   the successive factors are vector groups with a linear action of
   $G$. This verifies for such $G$ an assumption made in earlier work of
   the author on the existence of Levi factors.
   
   On the other hand, for any field $k$ of positive characteristic we
   show that if the category of representations of $G$ is not semisimple,
   there is an action of $G$ on a suitable vector group $U$ which is not
   linear.

## Levi factors of the special fiber of a parahoric group scheme and tame ramification {#levi-factors-of-the-special-fiber-of-a-parahoric-group-scheme-and-tame-ramification}

   **Abstract:**
   Let $A$ be a Henselian discrete valuation ring with fractions $K$ and
   with *perfect* residue field $k$ of characteristic $p\gt 0$.  Let $G$
   be a connected and reductive algebraic group over $K$, and let $P$ be
   a parahoric group scheme over $A$ with generic fiber $P_K = G$. The
   special fiber $P_k$ is a linear algebraic group over $k$.
     
   If $G$ splits over an unramified extension of $K$, we proved in some
   previous work that the special fiber $P_k$ has a Levi factor, and
   that any two Levi factors of $P_k$ are geometrically conjugate.  In
   the present paper, we extend a portion of this result. Following a
   suggestion of Gopal Prasad, we prove that if $G$ splits over a *tamely
   ramified* extension of $K$, then the *geometric* special fiber
   $P_{\overline{k}}$ has a Levi factor.

## On the descent of Levi factors {#on-the-descent-of-levi-factors}
   **Citation:** Archiv der Mathematik 100 (2013), no. 1, pp. 7--24.
   
   
   
   
   URLs: [[PDF]](/assets/manuscripts/on-the-descent-of-levi-factors.pdf), [[MR]](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=MR3009659) and [[DOI]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00013-012-0467-y).
   
   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group over a field $k$ of characteristic
   $p\gt0$, and suppose that the unipotent radical $R$ of $G$ is defined
   and split over $k$.  By a Levi factor of $G$, one means a closed
   subgroup $M$ which is a complement to $R$ in $G$.  In this paper, we
   give two results related to the descent of Levi factors.
     
   First, suppose $ℓ$ is a finite Galois extension of $k$ for which the
   extension degree $[ℓ:k]$ is relatively prime to $p$. If $G_{\ell}$
   has a Levi decomposition, we show that $G$ has a Levi
   decomposition. Second, suppose that there is a $G$-equivariant
   isomorphism of algebraic groups $R \simeq \operatorname{Lie}(R)$ --
   i.e. $R$ is a vector group with a linear action of the reductive
   quotient $G/R$.  If $G_L$ has a Levi decomposition for a separable
   closure $L=k_{\operatorname{sep}}$ of $k$, then $G$ has a Levi
   decomposition.
   
   Finally, we give an example of a disconnected, abelian, linear
   algebraic group $G$ for which $G_L$ has a Levi decomposition over a
   separable closure $L$, but $G$ itself has no Levi decomposition.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a connected and reductive algebraic group over an
   algebraically closed field of characteristic $p\gt 0$.  An interesting
   class of representations of $G$ consists of those $G$-modules having a
   *good filtration* -- i.e. a filtration whose layers are the *standard*
   highest weight modules obtained as the space of global sections of $G$
   linearized line bundles on the flag variety of $G$. Let $H \subset G$
   be a connected and reductive subgroup of $G$. One says that $(G,H)$ is
   a *Donkin pair*, or that $H$ is a *good filtration subgroup* of $G$,
   if whenever the $G$-module $V$ has a good filtration, the $H$-module
   $\operatorname{res}^G_H V$ has a good filtration.
   
   In this paper, we show when $G$ is a “classical group” that the
   *optimal* $\operatorname{SL}(2)$ subgroups of $G$ are good filtration
   subgroups. We also consider the cases of subsystem subgroups in all
   types and determine some primes for which they are good filtration
   subgroups.

   **Abstract:**
   If $G$ is a connected linear algebraic group over the field $k$, a
   Levi factor of $G$ is a reductive complement to the unipotent radical
   of $G$.  If $k$ has positive characteristic, $G$ may have no Levi
   factor, or $G$ may have Levi factors which are not geometrically
   conjugate. We give in this paper some *sufficient* conditions for the
   existence and the conjugacy of Levi factors of $G$.
     
   Let $A$ be a Henselian discrete valuation ring with fractions $K$ and
   with *perfect* residue field $k$ of characteristic $p \gt 0$.  Let $G$
   be a connected and reductive algebraic group over $K$.  Bruhat and
   Tits have associated to $G$ certain smooth $A$ group schemes $P$ whose
   generic fibers $P_k$ coincide with $G$; these are known as *parahoric
   group schemes*. The special fiber $P_k$ of a parahoric group scheme is
   a linear algebraic group over $k$. If $G$ splits over an unramified
   extension of $K$, we show that $P_k$ has a Levi factor, and that any
   two Levi factors of $P_k$ are geometrically conjugate.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over a field $K$ whose
   characteristic is *very good* for $G$, and let σ be any $G$
   equivariant isomorphism from the nilpotent variety to the unipotent
   variety; the map σ is known as a Springer isomorphism.  Let $y \in
   G(K)$, let $Y ∈ \operatorname{Lie}(G)(K)$, and write $C_y = C_G(y)$
   and $C_Y= C_G(Y)$ for the centralizers. We show that the center of
   $C_y$ and the center of $C_Y$ are smooth group schemes over $K$. The
   existence of a Springer isomorphism is used to treat the crucial cases
   where $y$ is unipotent and where $Y$ is nilpotent.
   
   Now suppose $G$ to be quasisplit, and write $C$ for the centralizer of
   a rational *regular* nilpotent element.  We obtain a description of
   the normalizer $N_G(C)$ of $C$, and we show that the automorphism of
   $\operatorname{Lie}(C)$ determined by the differential of σ at zero is
   a scalar multiple of the identity; these results verify observations
   of J-P. Serre.

   Let $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ be the Lie algebra of a
   semisimple linear algebraic group. Under mild conditions on the
   characteristic of the underlying field, one can show that any
   subalgebra of $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ consisting of nilpotent
   elements is contained in some Borel subalgebra. In this Note, we
   provide examples for each semisimple group $G$ and for each of
   the torsion primes for $G$ of nil subalgebras not lying in any
   Borel subalgebra of $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $F$ be an algebraically closed field and let $G$ be a
   semisimple algebraic $F$-group for which the characteristic of
   $F$ is *very good*.  If $X ∈ \operatorname{Lie}(G) =
   \operatorname{Lie}(G)(F)$ is a nilpotent element in the Lie
   algebra of $G$, and if $C$ is the centralizer in $G$
   of $X$, we show that (i) the root datum of a Levi factor of
   $C$, and (ii) the component group $C/C^o$ both depend only
   on the Bala-Carter label of $X$; i.e. both are independent of
   very good characteristic.  The result in case (ii) depends on the
   known case when $G$ is (simple and) of adjoint type.
     
   The proofs are achieved by studying the centralizer $C$ of a
   nilpotent section $X$ in the Lie algebra of a suitable
   semisimple group scheme over a Noetherian, normal, local ring
   $A$. When the centralizer of $X$ is equidimensional on
   $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, a crucial result is that locally in
   the étale topology there is a smooth $A$ subgroup scheme
   $L$ of $C$ such that $L_t$ is a Levi factor of
   $C_t$ for each $t ∈ \operatorname{Spec}(A)$.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a connected and reductive group over the algebraically
   closed field $K$. J-P. Serre has introduced the notion of a G
   completely reducible subgroup $H ⊂ G$.  In this note, we give a notion
   of $G$ complete reducibility -- $G$-cr for short -- for Lie
   subalgebras of $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$, and we show that if the closed
   subgroup $H ⊂ G$ is $G$-cr, then $\operatorname{Lie}(H)$ is $G$-cr as
   well.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $K$ be any field, and let $G$ be a semisimple group
   over $K$.  Suppose the characteristic of $K$ is positive
   and is very good for $G$.  We describe all group scheme
   homomorphisms $ϕ:SL(2) → G$ whose image is geometrically
   $G$ completely reducible -- or $G$-cr -- in the sense of
   Serre; the description resembles that of irreducible modules given
   by Steinberg's tensor product theorem. In case $K$ is
   algebraically closed and $G$ is simple, the result proved here
   was previously obtained by Liebeck and Seitz using different
   methods.  A recent result shows the Lie algebra of the image of ϕ
   to be geometrically $G$-cr; this plays an important role in
   our proof.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $X$ and $Y$ be commuting nilpotent $K$ endomorphisms of a vector
   space $V$, where $K$ is a field of characteristic $p ≥ 0$. If $F=K(t)$
   is the field of rational functions on the projective line
   $\mathbf{P}^1_K$, consider the $K(t)$ endomorphism $A=X+tY$ of $V$. If
   $p=0$, or if $A^{p-1}=0$, we show here that $X$ and $Y$ are tangent to
   the unipotent radical of the centralizer of $A$ in
   $\operatorname{GL}(V)$.  For all geometric points $(a:b)$ of a
   suitable open subset of $\mathbf{P}^1$, it follows that $X$ and $Y$
   are tangent to the unipotent radical of the centralizer of $aX +
   bY$. This answers a question of J. Pevtsova.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a semisimple group over an algebraically closed field of
   *very good* characteristic for $G$.  In the context of geometric
   invariant theory, G. Kempf has associated optimal cocharacters of $G$
   to an unstable vector in a linear $G$-representation. If the nilpotent
   element $X ∈ \operatorname{Lie}(G)$ lies in the image of the
   differential of a homomorphism $\operatorname{SL}(2) → G$, we say that
   homomorphism is optimal for $X$, or simply optimal, provided that its
   restriction to a suitable torus of $\operatorname{SL}(2)$ is optimal
   for X in Kempf's sense.
   
   We show here that any two $\operatorname{SL}(2)$ homomorphisms which
   are optimal for $X$ are conjugate under the connected centralizer of
   $X$.  This implies, for example, that there is a unique conjugacy
   class of *principal homomorphisms* for $G$. We show that the image of
   an optimal $\operatorname{SL}(2)$ homomorphism is a *completely
   reducible* subgroup of $G$; this is a notion defined recently by
   J-P. Serre.  Finally, if $G$ is defined over the (arbitrary) subfield
   $K$ of $k$, and if $X ∈ \operatorname{Lie}(G)(K)$ is a $K$-rational
   nilpotent element with $X^{[p]}=0$, we show that there is an optimal
   homomorphism for $X$ which is defined over $K$.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $X$ be an $F$-rational nilpotent element in the Lie
   algebra of a connected and reductive group $G$ defined over
   the ground field $F$.  Suppose that the Lie algebra has a
   non-degenerate invariant bilinear form.  We show that the
   unipotent radical of the centralizer of X is $F$-split. This
   property has several consequences.  When $F$ is complete with
   respect to a discrete valuation with either finite or
   algebraically closed residue field, we deduce a uniform proof that
   $G(F)$ has finitely many nilpotent orbits in
   $\operatorname{Lie}(G)(F)$.  When the residue field is
   finite, we obtain a proof that nilpotent orbital integrals
   converge. Under some further (fairly mild) assumptions on $G$,
   we prove convergence for arbitrary orbital integrals on the Lie
   algebra and on the group.  The convergence of orbital integrals in
   the case where $F$ has characteristic 0 was obtained by
   Deligne and Ranga Rao (1972).

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a reductive group over an algebraically closed
   field of characteristic $p$, and let $u ∈ G$ be a
   unipotent element of order $p$. Suppose that $p$ is a good
   prime for $G$. We show in this paper that there is a
   homomorphism $ϕ:\operatorname{SL}(2)_k → G$ whose image
   contains $u$. This result was first obtained by D. Testerman
   (J. Algebra, 1995) using case considerations for each type of
   simple group (and using, in some cases, computer calculations with
   explicit representatives for the unipotent orbits).
   
   The proof we give is free of case considerations (except in its
   dependence on the Bala-Carter theorem). Our construction of ϕ
   generalizes the construction of a principal homomorphism made by
   J.-P.  Serre in (Invent. Math. 1996); in particular, ϕ is obtained
   by reduction modulo $\mathfrak{P}$ from a homomorphism of
   group schemes over a valuation ring $A$ in a number field.
   This permits us to show moreover that the weight spaces of a
   maximal torus of $ϕ(\operatorname{SL}(2)$ on
   $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ are “the same as in characteristic
   0”; the existence of a ϕ with this property was previously
   obtained, again using case considerations, by Lawther and
   Testerman (Memoirs AMS, 1999) and has been applied in some recent
   work of G.  Seitz (Invent. Math. 2000).

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a quasisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed
   field of characteristic $p>0$. We suppose that $p$ is *very good* for
   G; since $p$ is good, there is a bijection between the nilpotent
   orbits in the Lie algebra and the unipotent classes in $G$. If the
   nilpotent $X ∈ \operatorname{Lie}(G)$ and the unipotent $u ∈ G$
   correspond under this bijection, and if $u$ has order $p$, we show
   that the partitions of $\operatorname{ad}(X)$ and
   $\operatorname{ad}(u)$ are the same.  When G is classical or of type
   $G_2$, we prove this result with no assumption on the order of $u$.
   
   In the cases where $u$ has order $p$, the result is achieved through
   an application of results of Seitz concerning good $A_1$ subgroups of
   $G$. For classical groups, the techniques are more elementary, and
   they lead also to a new proof of the following result of Fossum: the
   structure constants of the representation ring of a 1-dimensional
   formal group law $F$ are independent of $F$.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a connected, reductive group over an algebraically
   closed field of good characteristic.  For $u ∈ G$ unipotent,
   we describe the conjugacy classes in the component group
   $A(u)$ of the centralizer of $u$.  Our results extend work
   of the second author done for simple, adjoint $G$ over the
   complex numbers.
   
   When $G$ is simple and adjoint, the previous work of the
   second author makes our description combinatorial and explicit;
   moreover, it turns out that knowledge of the conjugacy classes
   suffices to determine the group structure of $A(u)$. Thus we
   obtain the result, previously known through case-checking, that
   the structure of the component group $A(u)$ is independent of
   good characteristic.

   **Abstract:**
   Let $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over an algebraically
   closed field $k$ of characteristic $p > 0$. The purpose of this paper
   is two-fold. First, when $p$ is a good prime, we give a new proof of
   the “order formula” of D. Testerman for unipotent elements in $G$;
   moreover, we show that the same formula determines the $p$-nilpotence
   degree of the corresponding nilpotent elements in the Lie algebra
   $\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ of $G$.
   
   Second, if $G$ is semisimple and $p$ is sufficiently large, we show
   that $G$ always has a faithful representation $(ρ,V)$ with the
   property that the exponential of $dρ(X)$ lies in $ρ(G)$ for each
   $p$-nilpotent $X ∈ \operatorname{Lie}(G)$.  This property permits a
   simplification of the description given by Suslin, Friedlander, and
   Bendel of the (even) cohomology ring for the Frobenius kernels $G_d$,
   $d ≥ 2$. The previous authors already observed that the natural
   representation of a classical group has the above property (with no
   restriction on $p$.  Our methods apply to any Chevalley group and
   hence give the result also for quasisimple groups with “exceptional
   type” root systems.  The methods give explicit sufficient conditions
   on $p$; for an adjoint semisimple G with Coxeter number $h$, the
   condition $p > 2h-2$ is always good enough.
